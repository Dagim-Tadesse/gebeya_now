# Flutter Mobile Programming — Course Workspace

## About Me

- **Name:** Dagim Tadesse
- **University:** Addis Ababa Science and Technology University
- **Department:** Software Engineering

## Workspace Overview

This workspace hosts practice projects and demos for Flutter mobile development. The main sample app currently is in:

- [Demo_facebook_hompage](Demo_facebook_hompage): A learning project that explores UI layout, navigation, and Firebase authentication.

## Getting Started

From any project folder:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

If Android builds fail due to network downloads (Gradle/Google storage), check internet/DNS/proxy settings and retry.

## Goals

- Learn Flutter UI, navigation, and state management basics
- Integrate Firebase Auth and Firestore
- Practice multi-platform builds (Android/Web/Desktop)

## Contact

Feel free to explore the projects and improve them over time.
